# ViterbiNet
A deep learning based Viterbi algorithm for symbol detection


The implementation of ViterbiNet consists of two functions:
  -  GetViterbiNet - generate and train ViterbiNet detector.
  -  ApplyViterbiNet - use trained model to detect symbols.
A code example for evaluating ViterbiNet can be found in the script Test_ViterbiNet.m


Installation:
  1. Download the .zip file
  2. Extract the folder inside
  3. Open for_redistribution_files_only folder
  4. Run  ViterbiNetApp.exe
